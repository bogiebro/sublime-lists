# Lists for Sublime Text 3

## Introduction
This package provides commands and macros for manipulating and navigating Markdown style lists. It supports lists with numbers, letters or bullets, and can navigate plain indented text as well.

## Usage
The default keyboard shortcuts are defined as follows:
- `alt+enter` creates a sibling below the current list item
- `super+alt+enter` creates an aunt below the current list item
- `ctrl-r` updates any incorrect list markers from the current list item onwards (useful after deleting items or changing a marker style).
- `super+shift+alt+up` moves to the previous list item with the same indentation level and marker style.
- `super+shift+alt+down` moves to the next list item with the same indentation level and marker style.
